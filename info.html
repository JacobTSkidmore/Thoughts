        Right here! <a href="view.html">Blog View</a> will show you all posted blogs in a manueverable way. The <a href="index.html">home page</a> shows the latest blog post and some photos.

      <div class="how hidden">
        With the power of a little bit of magic from html, css and javascript. I post from a login form that allows me access to simply type out the blogs and send them.
